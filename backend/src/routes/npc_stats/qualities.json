For example, if a character only had one Bruised and one Injured Condition remaining, she would only mark Bruised.

Choose a Purview — when wielding the item, she may channel it to create marvels at the cost of 1 Tension. Play fair — if the player characters defeat the Antagonist and take her stuff, they get a totally cool Relic or other mystical object. No takebacks.

To resist this impulse (for example, to attempt to hide their true nature), the Antagonist must succeed on a difficulty 2 Desperation Pool roll. Failure does not necessarily mean immediate indulgence (this is left to the Storyguide’s discretion), but some behavioral quirk shines through. An Occult roll (difficulty 2) is necessary to discern the Antagonist’s nature if the  Antagonist attempts to restrain themselves; if they indulge, the roll is difficulty 1 instead. If the Antagonist has one or more Flairs on Cooldown, indulgence of the Antagonist’s Unnatural Hunger counts as satisfying one Cooldown condition —  Storyguide’s pick."
