If you use a Boon or marvel later in the same session, and the Storyguide agrees that it will help in bringing about the foretold events, you may draw on the divination to waive the cost of imbuing or spending a single point of Legend. Each use of this Boon only provides this benefit once.",

You predict a specific triumph or downfall the character will face, and impose a Condition that represents this destiny on them. If an action is likely to bring about the foretold fate, the Condition provides Enhancement 2. Actions that struggle against this destiny have their Difficulty increased by 1, or by 2 if they would make it outright impossible for it to come to fruition. These effects cut both ways — a blessing might make it more difficult for a warrior to undertake a plan if it would lead to his defeat, while a curse might give a foe an Enhancement on actions that lead to their downfall. This Condition resolves once the outcome you have predicted comes to pass, the Storyguide deems that it is no longer capable of being fulfilled, or you reclaim the Legend imbued in this Boon. It can also be lifted by magic capable of altering destiny, such as marvels of this Purview or the Fortune Purview.",

You may choose to gain a specific power or make an open-ended request for a Devá’s favor. If you make a specific request, you must contend with a limitation imposed its use by the Devá — a gift of invulnerability might apply against Gods, Titans, and their progeny, but not against mortals, while a loaned weapon might cease to work if you treat a child with less than full respect. If you make an open-ended request, the Storyguide chooses the power you receive, but it carries no restrictions. Usually, power granted by a Devá comes in the form of one of their Purviews’ Boons, one of their Callings’ knacks, or the temporary usage of one of their Relics, all of which last for one session. The Storyguide can also offer customized blessings. You can’t gain a power beyond your ability to learn normally, such as a God Boon while you are only a Hero. This Boon can also be used to call upon the favor of an asura (i.e. a Titan that possesses one of the Devá Pantheon Virtues). At the Storyguide’s discretion, it is possible to gain the favor of Gods and Titans from other pantheons with this Boon, although you may need to research what would please them or convince them to reciprocate your devotion.",

The Storyguide should try to give this answer in the form of a spontaneous, in-character poetic speech, villainous monologue, or other form of expository dialogue by the character in question (but they can just give you the answer out of character if that’s too much work).

You can only end this Boon once the spirit is ready to leave you. They never overstay their welcome out of malice, but some will press for just one more meal or one last smoke.

A character who finds their title disagreeable can resolve this Condition by undertaking a dramatic action that carries significant potential consequences in the service of their title’s duties, finally releasing themselves from its obligations.
